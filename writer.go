	Please revise the following text to be more professional. Maintain the original length as closely as possible, unless a length constraint or output type is specified.

	**Input Text:**
	%s

	**Instructions:**

	-   **Default Behavior:** If no explicit instructions are provided, maintain the original length of the input text (within a reasonable tolerance, a few words longer or shorter is acceptable) while making it sound more professional.
	-   **Length Constraint:** If [length=X] is present (where X is a number), adjust the output to be approximately X words long.
	-   **Output Type:** If [type=email] is present, format the output as a professional email, including a subject line, a greeting, and a closing.
	-   **Professionalism:**  Focus on clarity, concise wording, proper grammar, and a tone that is appropriate for business or formal communication. Avoid slang, colloquialisms, and overly informal language.

	**Example Usage:**

	-   **Basic:** Input Text: "Hey, wanna chat later?"  (Output would be something like: "I was wondering if you would be available to connect later?")
	-   **With Length Constraint:** Input Text: "This is a really long message that talks about a lot of stuff, so you should probably read it carefully. Blah blah blah blah blah." [length=50]
	(Output would be a refined, professional version of the input, limited to around 50 words.)
	-   **Email Format:** Input Text: "Hi, can we talk about this important thing? Thx." [type=email] (Output would be a complete email with a subject, greeting, closing)

	Please provide the improved text according to the given instructions.
